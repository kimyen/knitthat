# Basic Use Cases

## 1. Look up Stitches
As a beginner, I've just learned knit stitch and purl stitch and would like to be able to follow different rectangle knitting patterns composed of knit stitches and purl stitches. I want to quickly go to a row number, looking at stitch number x and figure out if I need a knit stitch or a purl stitch.

## 2. Calculate Number of Rows and Stitches Based on Gauge Swatch
As a plan-ahead knitter, trying to explore different types of yarn, I would like to be able to enter my gauge swatch information, including the number of rows and the number of stitched for 4"x4". Then I would like to be able to look up how wide and long (how many inches) x rows of y stitches per rows would take.

## 3. Track Yarn Stash
As a knitter, I want to make sure I have enough yarn for new projects. I would like to track the yarn skeins I currently have. I want to know:
* how many skeins for each type of yarn;
* how long is each skeins;
* the yarn weight and its recommanded needle size;
* its color(s) and/or its dye lot;
* where I bought it;

## 4. Track Needles
As a knitter, I want to make sure I have the sufficient needles for new projects. I would like to track the needles I currently have. I want to know:
* the needle size;
* its length;
* its type (Circular/ Straight/ Double Pointed);
* how many of each needle;
* the materials that it's made of;
* whre I brought it;

## 5. Search for New Projects/ Patterns
As a exploring knitter, I would like to look for projects filter by:
* the stitches that was used;
* the needle size that was used;
* the yarn length that was used;
* the tags on the projects/ patterns;

## 6. Save TODO Projects
As a plan-ahead knitter, I would like to save projects/ save pattern as a project to work on in the future. While saving a project, I may want to change the project details, including:
* the yarn that is used;
* the needles that are used;
* add personal notes;

## 7. Track a Working Project
As a record-tracking knitter, working on a project, I would like to record:
* how long it takes me to finish each piece on the project based on hours/ days;
* how long it takes me to finish the entire project based on hours/ days;
* how many stitches I have done;
* the pattern I have used for each pieces;
* the yarn that I have used;

## 8. Show Stats
As a achieving knitter, I would like to be able to retrieve my overall knitting status, including:
* the number of projects that I have finished/ TODOs;
* the number of stitches that I have knitted in general/ per week;
* the number of hours that I have been knitting in general/ per week;

## 9. Design New Pattern
As a designer, I would like to design a new pattern. While designing the new pattern, I would like to:
* create a pattern;
* in a pattern, add a new piece with a name;
* in a pattern, duplicate a piece with a new name;
* in a pattern, remove a piece;
* in a piece, add a new row;
* in a piece, duplicate a row;
* in a piece, remove a row;
* in a piece, move a row to position x;
* add a note to a particular piece;
* in a particular row, pick a stitch and add to position x;
* in a particular row, remove a stitch from position x;
* add a note to a particular row;
* add a note to the pattern;
* tag a pattern;
* save the pattern;
